Zenith is an open-source script injector designed for Roblox, serving as a foundation accessible to anyone. 
It utilizes the Celery API, which shows promise but requires significant refinement as many scripts are currently incompatible.
This is a Byfron Bypass so there always is a chance you may get banned.

If you use this source all I ask is just credit me aka ilycross

(There Is Currently A Working API In The Discord That You Can Use For Now Until Celery Is Back Up)
